# Woods Cree Dictionary Database Management

This repository contains scripts and documentation for managing ALTLab's Woods Cree dictionary database.

**This repository does _not_ (and should not) contain the actual dictonary database.** The ALTLab database, and the original sources it is based on, are located in the private ALTLab repo.

The database uses the [Data Format for Digital Linguistics][DaFoDiL] as its underlying data formatâ€”a set of recommendations for storing linguistic data in JSON.

## Sources

ALTLab's dictionary database is / will be aggregated from the following sources:

* the Cree-to-English portion of Colin Charles' Cree Dictionary (a.k.a. the Lac La Ronge Dictionary) (`LLR`)
  - See [Notes on the Lac La Ronge Dictionary](./LLR.md)

* an edited version of Arok Wolvengrey's _Cree: Words_ dictionary database (referred to as simply the "Woods Cree" database) (`CW`)
  - See [Notes on the _Cree: Words_ Dictionary](./CW)
